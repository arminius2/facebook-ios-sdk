Facebook iOS SDK
===========================

Several months ago, I thought the Facebook iOS sdk was a bit sloppy, so I went through it and made it more in my image.  I standardized strings used in outgoing HTTP communication, made some method names more descriptive, that sort of thing.  Nothing groundbreaking.  I'm just neurotic about code that should be self describing.
